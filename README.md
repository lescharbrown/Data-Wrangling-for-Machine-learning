# Data-Wrangling-for-Machine-learning

Before we can train a Machine Learning model, we need to clean our data.
If we donâ€™t clean our dataset, we will run into some problems during training. We need to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and sometimes apply feature scaling to our dataset.

After data preprocessing, we can now train our machine learning model.
